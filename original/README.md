## Old version of tracking daemon, uses VTP.

This is the last version of the tracking client from the old 'tracking' repo.  Uses the 'VTGS Tracking Protocol' (VTP) which is a simple comma delimited ASCII format for comms between the client and the daemon.  This was called 'v2.1'.  Keeping a copy in this repo as a reference.

See https://github.com/vt-gs/tracking_client for client.
